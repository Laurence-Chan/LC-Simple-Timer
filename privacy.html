    <h1>Privacy Policy for Simple Timer</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 25, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the Simple Timer macOS application ("the App").</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our core principle is simple: <strong>Simple Timer collects no personal information or user data.</strong></p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>

    <p>Simple Timer is designed to be a straightforward utility, and your privacy is paramount. We want to be absolutely clear: <strong>we do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any personally identifiable information.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect your name, email address, physical address, or phone number.</li>
        <li>We do not collect location data.</li>
        <li>We do not track your activity within the App.</li>
        <li>We do not use any form of analytics or tracking.</li>
        <li>We do not share any data, because we do not collect any data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions We Request</h2>

    <p>Simple Timer requests permission to send you notifications on macOS. This permission is used <strong>solely and exclusively</strong> for the App's core functionality: to alert you when a timer you have set has finished.</p>
    <p>We do not use these notifications for marketing, promotions, or any other purpose. We do not gather any data through the notification system.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>

    <p>Any timer settings or preferences you configure within Simple Timer are stored <strong>only locally on your Mac</strong>. This data resides solely on your device, and we do not have access to it, nor is it ever sent to us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>Simple Timer does not integrate with or use any third-party services that could collect information from you.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13, and since we do not collect any personal information, we do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
